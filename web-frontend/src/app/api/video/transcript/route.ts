Let me start by giving you an overview of what we'll cover in this session. This video is designed to provide you with both theoretical understanding and practical skills that you can immediately apply.

`

  // Add specific topics based on subject area
  specificTopics.forEach((topic, index) => {
    transcript += `${index + 1}. ${topic}

In this section, I'll walk you through ${topic.toLowerCase()}. We'll start with the fundamental concepts and then move on to practical examples. You'll see exactly how to implement these ideas in real-world scenarios.

Let me demonstrate this with a hands-on example. As you can see here, when we apply these principles, we get immediate results. This is particularly important because it helps you understand not just the "what" but also the "why" behind each concept.

Now, let's look at some common challenges you might face when working with this topic. I've seen many students struggle with this particular aspect, so I want to make sure we address it thoroughly.

`
  })

  transcript += `As we wrap up this section, let me share some pro tips that will help you avoid common pitfalls. These are insights I've gained from years of experience in ${subject.toLowerCase()}, and they can save you significant time and effort.

Remember, the key to mastering ${subject.toLowerCase()} is consistent practice and application. Don't just watch this video - make sure to try out these concepts yourself.

In our next segment, we'll build upon what we've learned here and explore more advanced techniques. But for now, take some time to practice what we've covered.

I encourage you to pause the video at any point if you need to review something or try it out yourself. Learning is most effective when it's interactive and hands-on.

Thank you for joining me in this lesson on ${videoTitle}. I hope you found this content valuable and that it helps you in your ${subject.toLowerCase()} journey. Don't forget to practice these concepts and feel free to revisit this material whenever you need a refresher.

Keep learning, keep practicing, and I'll see you in the next video!`
